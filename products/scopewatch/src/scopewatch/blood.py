"""Blood on the field: segment it, measure its area, turn area into a volume interval.

The hard part is not finding red pixels. Everything in an abdomen is red. The
discriminator between perfused tissue and pooled blood is that pooled blood is
*both* further along the red-green axis *and* darker, because a pool absorbs the
scope's own light instead of scattering it back. That is why the winning decision
here is two-dimensional in CIE Lab and not a hue range in HSV; `experiments.py`
scores five candidates against masks known by construction and writes the numbers
into docs/evaluation.md.

Area to volume is where a tool like this usually starts lying. Pixel area is not
millilitres. To get from one to the other you need a scale (millimetres per pixel,
recovered from an object of known size in the same plane) and a depth (how thick
the film is, which a single camera cannot see). We recover the first and we refuse
to pretend about the second: the depth is an assumption with a stated range, and
every volume Scopewatch reports is the interval that range produces, never a point.

# Segmentation is not perfect and saying so costs nothing. But a single relative
# error is the wrong shape for this estimator, and the area sweep shows why: the
# error is not a constant percentage, it is a roughly constant *number of pixels*
# of false positive - surface vessels and inflamed serosa that survive both votes -
# divided by however big the pool is. At 70,000 pixels that floor is under 1% of
# the answer; at 4,000 pixels it is most of it.
#
# So the uncertainty is a function of the measurement. `FALSE_POSITIVE_FLOOR_PX` is
# the median area returned on synthetic fields that contain no blood at all;
# `AREA_SHAPE_SIGMA` is what is left over once the pool is large enough for the
# floor not to matter - boundary placement, the specular exclusion, morphology.
# Both come from `evaluate.py` and both are quoted in docs/evaluation.md.
# Both of these are deliberately larger than the synthetic sweep measures, and that
# is a judgement rather than an oversight.
#
# What the sweep measures, once the illumination estimate and the darkness cut were
# fixed: a false-positive floor of **zero pixels** on fields containing no blood, and
# a relative area error with a standard deviation of **0.54%** on pools of four
# thousand pixels and up. Printing an interval built from those numbers would claim a
# precision that belongs to the renderer, not to tissue. A synthetic pool has a clean
# boundary, a single illuminant and no fat, no bile, no cautery char and no irrigation
# fluid, and the real floor is unknown because we have no clinical video.
#
# So the floor is set at 600 pixels rather than zero, and the shape sigma at 5% rather
# than 0.54%, roughly a ten-fold inflation of what was measured. If and when clinical

    A laparoscope's light source sits at the tip of the scope, a few centimetres

    darker than the centre by a factor of two or more. The darkness vote in
    `segment_lab_ad` cannot tell that apart from a pool, and the result is a ring of
    false positives around the edge of every frame - which is exactly what the small
    pool sizes in the sweep were picking up.

    Dividing by this estimate is the standard illumination-normalisation step. The
    excluded region - the black surround outside the scope's circle, and the candidate
    blood - is filled by **normalised convolution** rather than by the field's mean.

    That distinction is not cosmetic and it cost a real false positive. Filling a hole
    with the global mean puts the *average* brightness of the whole frame into a place
    whose neighbours are much darker, because the scope's light falls off radially. The
    estimate there comes out too high, dividing by it makes the region look too dark,
    and a patch of inflamed serosa sitting off-centre is then reported as a pool of
    blood - fourteen thousand pixels of it, on a frame whose true pool was a thousand.
    Normalised convolution propagates the *neighbouring* illumination into the hole,
    which is what an illumination estimate should do.

    The blur is done on a downscaled copy. The sigma this needs is about a fifth of
    the frame, and a Gaussian that wide costs 300 milliseconds a frame at 960 by 540 -
    which was seventy per cent of the whole pipeline, to compute a field that has no
    detail in it by construction. Shrinking by eight, blurring there, and scaling the

    """Candidate 7: saturated red for its lightness, and redder than this scene.

    This replaced `ratio_dark` after real footage, and the reasons are specific.

    `ratio_dark` asked for pixels far above the *tissue mode* in redness and darker
    than the tissue around them. On a field where blood is a large share of the view
    (the WSES ulcer repair) the redness mode is partly blood and a lighting-flattened
    pool is no darker than its neighbours, so a bleeding field read 0.00 ml on 555 of
    561 frames. And "darker than its surroundings" is exactly what vignetting and rim
    shadow are, which is how shadowed peritoneum at the edge of the Barroso clip
    became 9.97 ml.

    This decision does not use darkness as evidence of blood at all. It uses chroma
    per unit lightness: blood is deeply coloured for how light it is, while shadow is
    dark *and* grey, and pink perfused tissue is coloured but light. The hue must be
    red, and on top of those absolute tests the pixel must be more saturated than the
    scene's own median by SCENE_CHROMA_RATIO, because under a warm light source a
    whole field of bowel or muscle can pass the absolute tests (the Kavalakat and TEP
    clips). The rim is removed and badly lit regions are not classified.

    Specular highlights on wet blood are near-white and fail every colour test, so a
    highlight that sits inside or against a blood region is filled back in.

    What it still cannot do, measured on held-out real clips: separate blood from
    red tissue that is as saturated as blood relative to its scene. Its pixel
    precision there is low; docs/evaluation.md has the numbers.
