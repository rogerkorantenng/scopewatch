"""The time series: smoothing, camera motion, rate of change, and bleeding onset.

The question "when did this start bleeding" is a change-point question on a noisy
series, and the two ways to get it wrong are both common.

The first is to threshold the volume itself. That answers "when was there a lot of
blood", which is minutes later than the event you wanted and is exactly the delay a
surgeon already has by eye.

The second is to threshold the raw first difference. Laparoscopic video is a
handheld camera in a moving cavity, so the frame-to-frame difference is dominated
by the scope panning across a pool that was already there. A pan produces the same
positive slope as a bleed, and a tool that cannot tell them apart will timestamp
every camera movement as a haemorrhage.

So: fit a slope by least squares over a window, in millilitres per minute, and
require a one-sided CUSUM on the same series to agree. Gate both on a global motion
estimate from phase correlation, so frames where the field moved do not contribute
a rate. The reported onset carries the window length as its uncertainty, because
that is genuinely how well a windowed estimator can localise a step.
